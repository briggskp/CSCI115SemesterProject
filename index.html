      <h2>Like the Beach?</h2>
      <p>There are three different categories of beach-goers. They are generally understood as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>'Competitive' Athletes</li>
        <li>Leisure Lovers</li>
        <li>Fitness Enthusiasts</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first category, typically consisting of younger folks, enjoy playing beach sports like volleyball, surfing, and paddleboarding. The second category is a mix of younger and older audiences who enjoy sitting in their beach chairs or laying out and getting tan. Fitness enthusiasts generally walk or run along the beach, and stop periodically to take in the peaceful crashing waves. They all have one thing in common: they enjoy being at the beach.</p>
      <p>These categories of people can be divided into two types: the Litter Bugs and the Environmentalists. The litter bugs fail to clean up after themselves during their beach visit, and their trash winds up in the habitats of various sea life - and namely harms our sea turtles.</p>
      <p>The environmentalists are aware of the litter problems, and the decreasing numbers of sea turtles species, and they attempt to fix it.</p>
      <h2>Sea Turtle Conservation</h2>
      <p>Every day we are reminded of the dangers of climate change and global warming on social media, sea level changes, and in "fake news." Our top political leaders are endorsing behavior that is detrimental for, unfortunately, everyone.</p>
      <p>In Charleston, one of our biggest symbols is the sea turtle. They are majestic and wise creatures, and their qualities reflect Charlestonians accurately. Their numbers are decreasing drastically, and the community can play a huge role in saving them.
      <p>Climate problems might be too big for just one person or a handful of people to solve, but to join the surrounding community together would make a difference in sea turtle conservation almost immediately.</p>
