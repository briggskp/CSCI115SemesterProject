<h2> Potential Sources of Inspiration: </h2>

<h4> Sea Turtle Care Center Site </h4>
<p> This website provides heartwarming stories on individuals who have been successful in nurturing injured sea turtles back to health. This website is one I would take inspiration from in both design and content areas.
<a href="http://www.scaquarium.org/sea-turtle-care-center/"> http://www.scaquarium.org/sea-turtle-care-center/ </a> </p>

<h4> The State of the World's Sea Turtles </h4>
<p> This website has very basic design elements, and does not incorporate them very well. This website would be used solely for information.
<a href="http://www.seaturtlestatus.org/"> http://www.seaturtlestatus.org/ </a> </p>

<h4> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Site </h4>
<p> This site has professional fonts, color schemes, and images. It is easy to navigate through. Overall it is a clean design, and will definitely be a huge source of inspiration for my project.
